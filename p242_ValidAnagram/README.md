Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example 1:

```java
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:

```java
Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:


```java
1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 104
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
```
